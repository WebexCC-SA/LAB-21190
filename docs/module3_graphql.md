# Module 3 — GraphQL for Historical and Real-Time Reports

## Objective

Use the Webex Contact Center GraphQL Search API to answer business questions about contacts and agents, then keep a live agent-state table current with the Activities API.

Queries use the **organization ID from Setup**. You may enter the full dictionary path (e.g. `activities.nodes.queueName`) or the leaf name (e.g. `queueName`).
